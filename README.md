## What Is Needed

These are the tools and items that I have found to work well to make the system work with as little overhead costs as possible.

### Containers

Basically, you will need any available containers that can hold liquid, stand up to the weight of a plant, and is self-contained other than any holes that you put in it.

If you want to support a good cause, then I recommend going to your local Firehouse Subs and purchasing any of their pickle buckets they have available (if there are any). Firehouse Subs sells empty pickle bucket for just $3 at participating locations â€” with proceeds going to the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation. The 5-gallon food-safe container is made of sturdy plastic and comes with a lid.



### Hydroponic Mineral Solution

So far, the solution that works for me in a all-around general use is the [MASTERBLEND 4-18-38](https://www.amazon.com/MASTERBLEND-4-18-38-Complete-Combo-Fertilizer/dp/B072F2BL9D) kit that you can get from Amazon rather easily (link goes to amaon, no referral link or anything). 



### Plant Collars

THe cheapest and most efficient wat to collar the plants in the container are the [pool noodles you find at Dollar Tree](https://www.dollartree.com/brightly-colored-swim-noodles-47-in/329034) or similar stores. These are the smaller diameter noodles that are rather low cost. 

Each of these pool noodles are 54 inches long.

You will want to cut the pool noodle at roughly 2 inch sections. This will net you 27 plant collars from one pool noodle. A 5 gallon bucket can hold 9 plant collars, so this will be enough for 3 full 5 gallon buckets.


## Mixing the Nutrient Solution Properly

The correct way to mix Masterblend Tomato formula 4-18-38 to use in your off grid, non circulating hydroponics.

The [MASTERBLEND 4-18-38](https://www.amazon.com/MASTERBLEND-4-18-38-Complete-Combo-Fertilizer/dp/B072F2BL9D) comes as a kit with the 4-18-38 Tomato and Vegetable growth formula, 15.5-0-0 Calcium Nitrate, and Epson Salt.

Based on a 5 gallon amount that is made, you mix the nutrient solution as follows - 

The classic MasterBlend recipe calls for 12g MasterBlend, 12g Calcium Nitrate, and 6g Epsom Salt for 5 gallons of nutrient solution, where each component is mixed into the water individually. 

12 grams of the Masterblend 4-18-38
6 grams of Epson Salt (Magnesium Sulfate)

Add the above amounts of the nutrients to 5 gallons of water (nearly to the top of a Firehouse Pickle bucket).

Once the nutrients are fully suspended and turns into a solution, add the following - 

12 grams of the Calcium Nitrate 15-0-0

Then mix the nutrient solution again until everything if sully dissolved.

This mix is safe to mix ahead of time as it will set and stay viable for 6 months.

If you are mixing in a 2.5 gallon container, or a larger one, adjust the rations accordingly as it is a 2:2:1 ratio.

TIP - Fill the bucket with a hose at a fairly high pressure - dump in 12grams of the Masterblend 4-18-38, when about 1/3rd full dump in the 12grams of the Calcium Nitrate 15-0-0, when 2/3rds dump in6grams of Epson Salt. The water splashing around does all the mixing for you!

TIP #2 - If you dont have a way to weight out grams, you can instead remember that 1 teaspoon is nearly 6 grams (using baking rules). So the ratio with teaspoons for 5 gallons of water would be - 

2tsp of the Masterblend 4-18-38
1tsp of Epson Salt (Magnesium Sulfate)
2tsp of the Calcium Nitrate 15-0-0
