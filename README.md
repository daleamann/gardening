## What Is Needed

These are the tools and items that I have found to work well to make the system work with as little overhead costs as possible.

### Containers

Basically, you will need any available containers that can hold liquid, stand up to the weight of a plant, and is self-contained other than any holes that you put in it.

If you want to support a good cause, then I recommend going to your local Firehouse Subs and purchasing any of their pickle buckets they have available (if there are any). Firehouse Subs sells empty pickle bucket for just $3 at participating locations — with proceeds going to the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation. The 5-gallon food-safe container is made of sturdy plastic and comes with a lid.



### Hydroponic Mineral Solution

So far, the solution that works for me in a all-around general use is the [MASTERBLEND 4-18-38](https://www.amazon.com/MASTERBLEND-4-18-38-Complete-Combo-Fertilizer/dp/B072F2BL9D) kit that you can get from Amazon rather easily (link goes to amaon, no referral link or anything). 



### Plant Collars

THe cheapest and most efficient wat to collar the plants in the container are the [pool noodles you find at Dollar Tree](https://www.dollartree.com/brightly-colored-swim-noodles-47-in/329034) or similar stores. These are the smaller diameter noodles that are rather low cost. 

Each of these pool noodles are 54 inches long.

You will want to cut the pool noodle at roughly 2 inch sections. This will net you 27 plant collars from one pool noodle. A 5 gallon bucket can hold 9 plant collars, so this will be enough for 3 full 5 gallon buckets.


## Mixing the Nutrient Solution Properly

The correct way to mix Masterblend Tomato formula 4-18-38 to use in your off grid, non circulating hydroponics.

The [MASTERBLEND 4-18-38](https://www.amazon.com/MASTERBLEND-4-18-38-Complete-Combo-Fertilizer/dp/B072F2BL9D) comes as a kit with the 4-18-38 Tomato and Vegetable growth formula, 15.5-0-0 Calcium Nitrate, and Epson Salt.

Based on a 5 gallon amount that is made, you mix the nutrient solution as follows - 

The classic MasterBlend recipe calls for 12g MasterBlend, 12g Calcium Nitrate, and 6g Epsom Salt for 5 gallons of nutrient solution, where each component is mixed into the water individually. 

12 grams of the Masterblend 4-18-38
6 grams of Epson Salt (Magnesium Sulfate)

Add the above amounts of the nutrients to 5 gallons of water (nearly to the top of a Firehouse Pickle bucket).

Once the nutrients are fully suspended and turns into a solution, add the following - 

12 grams of the Calcium Nitrate 15-0-0

Then mix the nutrient solution again until everything if sully dissolved.

This mix is safe to mix ahead of time as it will set and stay viable for 6 months.

If you are mixing in a 2.5 gallon container, or a larger one, adjust the rations accordingly as it is a 2:2:1 ratio.

TIP - Fill the bucket with a hose at a fairly high pressure - dump in 12grams of the Masterblend 4-18-38, when about 1/3rd full dump in the 12grams of the Calcium Nitrate 15-0-0, when 2/3rds dump in6grams of Epson Salt. The water splashing around does all the mixing for you!

TIP #2 - If you dont have a way to weight out grams, you can instead remember that 1 teaspoon is nearly 6 grams (using baking rules). So the ratio with teaspoons for 5 gallons of water would be - 

2tsp of the Masterblend 4-18-38
1tsp of Epson Salt (Magnesium Sulfate)
2tsp of the Calcium Nitrate 15-0-0

## Baker Creek Controversies

1. They support white supremacy and settler colonialism … example: they invited notorious racist Cliven Bundy to speak at their event. If you need “proof” that Bundy is racist, how about the fact that he said Black people might have been better off as slaves? Need more? Then you’re an idiot, but you can find more info by googling “Cliven Bundy racist.”

2) The organization that their Ukraine donations went to, World Help, manipulates people into converting to christianity in order to receive aid. The president of World Help, Vernon Brewer, once attempted to fly south Asian orphans to a christian orphanage (in spite of the fact that the children were Muslim) saying “what we were attempting to do in finding a home for these orphans is no different from what Mother Theresa did in placing Hindu orphans in a christian children’s home.”

3) Baker Creek sells sacred Indigenous seeds … without permission from tribes. One example of this is Pawnee Eagle Corn, which their growers crossed with other Indigenous varieties and renamed it “Montana Cudu Corn.” It would be like someone finding your car in a parking lot, changing the name on the title, and then bragging about what an amazing car they have. It’s wrong. It’s gross. It’s unethical.

4) Baker Creek has sent out their lawyers to silence the voices of Native seedkeepers. If you need “proof” of this, you’re not paying attention, and asking an Indigenous person to subject themselves to threats and trauma at the hands of a corporation (they are not a small business), is super shitty.

5) Baker Creek did, in fact, post white supremacist dog whistles on their page. They have tried to explain this away as being “sarcasm,” but their use of the word clan spelled with a “K” and their use of a modified Trump slogan, says everything. I am attaching a screenshot of their response below.

6) Baker Crk seeds are not organic. They use terms like “non-gmo” and “heirloom” in an effort to greenwash their seeds. They’re not organic.

7) Baker Creek tried to sell a GMO tomato made by a European company called NHP, a purple tomato in skin AND flesh, as a non-GMO.  NHP prompted them to test that the seeds were actually non-GMO. After this point, sales of the seed halted, but the reasoning for it was not acknowledged by Baker Creek. It was, instead, only addressed by NHP, who clarified that it had spoken with Baker Creek and they'd verified that the tomato was GM and had been mislabeled.

So, weeks after having halted the sale, Baker Creek released their statement on Facebook. That they had gotten the seeds from a traditional plant breeder of impeccable reputation, that their seeds had been tested for GMO and came back negative, and had done all their due diligence to make sure it wasn't GMO. But! They couldn't "rule it out." They couldn't "conclusively" prove it wasn't GMO. And because the threat of one of their wholesome and pure customers accidentally consuming an icky science tomato would haunt their conscience to no end, they had to stop the sales of the tomato out of an abundance of caution.

The reception, gauging from the Facebook comment section, seems rapturous. What angels! What guardians of seed purity and integrity! This only affirms how dedicated they are!

Okay but a few problems.

 - The language from NHP states, pretty explicitly, that the tomato is absolutely GMO, not some wishy washy language about being unable to rule it out authoritatively. It's presented as though the altered genes are an accidental contaminant. But there's no other tomato like this on the market -- that's why Baker Creek was promoting it so much! So they're still not being honest about this.

 - Baker Creek claims that they did test the tomato about being GM prior to being contacted by NHP, and that it came up negative. What they don't bother mentioning is what genes they tested for or why. There isn't some generic "genetically modified" marker, they would be testing for known modifications. Lack of clarity on this is unusual, especially when the modifications that make the tomato noteworthy (the health benefits of increased anthocyanins + strong color) are specifically touted by Baker Creek!

 - So if we're to believe the narrative released by Baker Creek, the genetic modifications that were developed in a specific place for a specific benefit and had not yet even hit the market had like... oopsie daisied into their tomato. The not-yet-released tomato tripped and fell and rewrote their tomato's DNA.

The other explanation would be that they were purposefully defrauded by a breeder who was not transparent about the lineage of the tomato they'd sold to Baker Creek, even knowing that it was going to be marketed as non-GMO. And yet, nowhere in Baker Creek post do they speak to this effect. They don't seem interested at all in where this seed came from! How magnanimous of them! Haha.

It seems sort of obvious that they really just craved something novel, fell in love with the tomato, didn't particularly care where it came from, and has felt pressured to put on this ridiculous show to try and square their catalog with their sloppy politics. For an offense initially so small, it's made worse by a litany of insultingly obvious lies. 

Again, my views are my own and do not reflect the views of any other person or organization. Personally, I do not recommend doing business with Baker Creek (plus, their germination rates are far lower than what their packages claim).
